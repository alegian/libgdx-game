# libgdx-game
This game was created as a university assignment at ELTE for the Software Technology Practice course. It was a team project, but I developed nearly all of the code (with my teammates handling graphics / text etc). This game is not meant to be monetized or distributed in any way and I do not own the images / textures used, nor the libgdx library.

## Game Rules / Standards Enforced by Assignment

### Introduction
Design and implement a real-time theme park simulator (time can be sped up).
The player has a rectangular area where she can build their own amusement park by placing buildings. The buildings can be different rides and attractions (games), and restaurants. The player can also build gardens and paths. She receives some initial funds to build a park at the start of the game. The park starts to receive guests when the player opens it. The guests have to pay an entry fee to get into the park. They can use the games, and buy food and drinks from the restaurants. The guests pay for these, and the prices are determined by the player. Some of the games may be covered by the entry fee.

### Games
We call both the rides and attractions “games”. Building games requires time and money. They can be built only on an empty area. Operating the games costs money, which is substracted from the money of the player each time the game is used.
The games can break down. When this happens, they have to be repaired by a repairman, which also costs money. The game cannot be used by the guests while it is repaired.
The games have a capacity (how many guests can use them at once), and a turn time (how long does one turn take on the game). The guests above capacity (the guests for whom there is no room on the ride yet) are waiting near the ride.
To summarize, a game can be in the following states: in use, waiting for guests, under repair, being built.

### Gardens
We can plant trees, shrubs, or grass on empty areas anywhere in the park. These costs money, but improve the mood of the guests.

### Restaurants
Guests get hungry or thirsty from time to time, so it is important for the park to have buffets, sweet shops, hotdog stands, etc. The guests have to pay for food and drinks of course.

### Paths
Pahts need to be built in the park. The guests can only get to places that are reachable from the entrance of the park. Building the paths costs money per tile.

### Guests
Guests like to periodically use the games or eat, drink. They choose the game or restaurant randomly. Their mood will diminish if they have to wait in line a lot at the game or restaurant of their choice. They will leave the park if their mood tanks (gets to zero).
Guests can only move around via the paths (they cannot step off the paths).
The mood of the guests is improved if they use a game or eat, drink. The willingness of the guests to use a game or buy something depends on the cost. We can assume that the guests have unlimited money in the context of the amusement park (we don’t have to keep a record of their money). Guests are prone to throw away the packaging of the food and drinks while walking. If they can find a thrashcan in the vicinity then they will go to it and throw the thrash into it. Otherwise they will just throw it away onto the path. Thrash on the paths decreases the mood of the guests.

### Staff
There are two kind of staff:
Cleaner: They keep the park clean by removing thrash from the paths. They move around in their designated area. More of them can be employed and they can also be moved around if they are needed elsewhere.
Repairman: They repair the games that are broken. Repairing a game costs time and money. They always go to and repair the game that has broken down the earliest.

### Tasks for Building the Game
Doing the view part of the game, implementing building.
Doing the model part which contains the games, the restaurants, plants, paths, and the staff.
Implementing pathfinding – the vertices of the graph will be the games, restaurants, crossroads of the paths, and the entrance of the park.
Implementing the logic of the game: the behaviour of the guests and staff and the logic of their interactions.

### Advice
Although the game is real-time, time of course flies in the simulation faster than in the real world.
In the prototype phase, the things in the game can be shown with temporary pictures. They should be changed to at least symbolic images in the final product.
The characters and the games don’t have to be animated. The games should show their status (in use, waiting, under repair, being built). The characters should move along the paths.
